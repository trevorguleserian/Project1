# The Streaming Service Guys

## Question 1:  What streaming service has the most content? The highest rated content?

 ### Based on our analysis, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Disney+ all offer different options for your viewing pleasure. If you base your decision solely on the amount of content available, you would chose Prime Video through Amazon. Prime Video offers over 13,000 titles for you to view, with almost 12,000 of those titles being movies. If TV shows are more to your liking, then you would choose Netflix, as it has the most TV shows available on its platform with over 1800.
 
 ### If ratings are driving your streaming service decision for movie choices, our analysis points toward Disney+ as they are the streaming service showing the best increase in movie ratings over time. For TV, we can conclude that Netflix, offers on average the highest rated TV shows on its platform. However, Disney+ is the only service that is showing a positive change in ratings for newer titles.
 
 ## Question 2:  Who are the top movie directors on streaming services?
 
 ### There were five directors identified who had at least 3 movies with IMDb scores greater than 8. Those directors include; Christopher Nolan, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Stephen J. Santos, and Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The movies these directors were noted for can be found on Netflix, Hulu, and/or Amazon Prime. We also noticed that the movies were directed between 1970 and 1990 or after the year 2000. We ended up removing a director, Rocco Urbisci, who directed 10 improv/stand-up comedy specials that had IMDb ratings higher than 8.
 
 ## Question 3: How did ratings vary over time?

### Movies:

#### * IMDb ratings have varied over time. Our analyses looked at average IMDb ratings for each decade. We also noted ratings may decreased over time due to the increase in volume of titles added or created for each streaming service.

#### Amazon Prime: Data varied the least on Prime with all TV shows having average IMDb ratings between approximately 7.0 and 7.7. 1940s were slightly better than the 1950s with an increase into the 1960s. The largest decrease happened in the 1970s with the lowest average ratings for that decade. The 1980s brought ratings back up but there was a steady decline until 2009. 2010s brought a slight increase, but 2020 saw a decline in ratings.
#### Disney+: The one Tv show in the 1950s was rated very high, Disney+ has no TV shows from the 1960s, and the 1 TV show from the 1970s is the lowest rated title on the platform.
