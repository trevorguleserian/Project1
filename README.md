# The Streaming Service Guys

## Project by: Dylan Obermueller, Dania Noyola , Jerod Rhodes, and Trevor Guleserian

## Question 1:  What streaming service has the most content? The highest rated content?

### Based on our analysis, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, or Disney+ all offer different options for your viewing pleasure. If you base your decision solely on the amount of content available, the top choice is Prime Video through Amazon. Prime Video offers over 13,000 titles for you to view, with almost 12,000 of those titles being movies. If TV shows are more to your liking, then the top choice would be Netflix, as it has the most TV shows available on its platform with over 1,800.
 
### If ratings are driving your streaming service decision for movie choices, our analysis points toward Disney+ as they are the streaming service showing the best increase in movie ratings over time. For TV, we can conclude that Netflix offers on average the highest rated TV shows on its platform. However, Disney+ is the only service that is showing a positive change in ratings for newer titles.
 
## Question 2:  Who are the top movie directors on streaming services?
 
### There were four directors identified who had at least 3 movies with IMDb scores greater than 8. Those directors include; Christopher Nolan, Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, and Hrishikesh Mukherjee. The movies these directors were noted for can be found on Netflix, Hulu, and/or Amazon Prime. We also noticed that the movies were directed between 1970 and 1990 or after the year 2000. We ended up removing two directors, Rocco Urbisci and Stephen J. Santos, who directed improv/stand-up comedy specials that had IMDb ratings higher than 8.
 
## Question 3: How did ratings vary over time?

### Movies:

#### * IMDb ratings have varied over time. Our analysis looked at average IMDb ratings for each decade. We also noted ratings may have decreased over time due to the increase in volume of titles added or created for each streaming service.
#### * Netflix: Shows volatility from 1940-1960s, and the one title from the 1950s has the lowest rating on the platform. There is steady decline in IMDb ratings from 1960-2010s and a final increase into 2020.
#### * Hulu: Shows steadily decline from 1920-1950s, an increase in the 1960s followed by a steady decline until 1999. There was an increase in the 2000s followed by steady decline through 2020.
#### * Amazon Prime: Shows a general decline over all decades with increases happening in 1920s, 1940s and from 1970-1980s.
#### * Disney+: Showed a general decline in movie ratings up to the year 2009 with increases in the 1950s and 1980s. From the year 2010, movies on Disney+ have shown a dramatic increase in overall ratings.

### TV Shows:

#### IMDb ratings have also varied over time while our analysis again looked at average IMDb ratings for each decade. As we noted earlier in movies, ratings may have decreased over time due to increased volume.
#### Netflix: The TV show in the 1950s was rated highly and there was a decrease to the 1960s. The was a slight increase in the 1970s followed by a continual decrease in average ratings through 2020.
#### Hulu: The one TV show in the 1930s started out high with a decease in the 1940s followed by an increase in the 1950s. Ratings continued to decline through the 1970s and saw a slight increase in the 1980s. Average ratings have continued to steadily decline since.
#### Amazon Prime: Data varied the least on Prime with all TV shows having average IMDb ratings between approximately 7.0 and 7.7. 1940s were slightly better than the 1950s with an increase into the 1960s. The largest decrease happened in the 1970s with the lowest average ratings for that decade. The 1980s brought ratings back up but there was a steady decline until 2009. 2010s brought a slight increase, but 2020 saw a decline in ratings.
#### Disney+: The one TV show in the 1950s was rated very high, Disney+ has no TV shows from the 1960s, and the 1 TV show from the 1970s is the lowest rated title on the platform. There was a moderate increase to the 1980s followed by a steady decline through 2009. Disney+ is the only platform showing an increase in average ratings for newer titles through 2020.
